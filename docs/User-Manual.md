# Introduction
Cyclone is an experimental Scheme-to-C compiler that uses a variant of the [Cheney on the MTA](http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/CheneyMTA.html) technique to implement full tail recursion, continuations, generational garbage collection, and native threads.

TODO: Contact
  - include information on bug reports (or should that go towards the beginning?)

# Requirements

Tested on Linux, x86 (32-bit) and ARM

Required packages:
- [Concurrency Kit](http://concurrencykit.org/)

    The best way to install libck is via a package manager such as `apt-get`. But if a package is not available for this library it can also be built from source. Just replace `0.5.0` below with the latest version available from their website:
    
        wget http://concurrencykit.org/releases/ck-0.5.0.tar.gz
        tar xfz ck-0.5.0.tar.gz ; cd ck-0.5.0 ; ./configure && make all && sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig
    
- make
- gcc

# Installation
TODO: installation procedure for cyclone-bootstrap
TODO: installation procedure for development????

# Usage

## Compiling Scheme Programs

A Scheme program may be compiled using the `cyclone` command:

    $ cyclone  examples/fac.scm
    $ examples/fac
    3628800

## Compiling Scheme Libraries

Scheme code can be organized into libraries that are compiled separately from programs. Cyclone intends a library to represent a single C module (or file) when compiled.

Each library must be placed into a `.sld` file that corresponds to the library name. For example, the library 

    (scheme cyclone util) 

would be defined in its `.sld` file as:

    (define-library (scheme cyclone util)
      ... )

and should be located in the file

    scheme/cyclone/util.sld

Cyclone will not automatically generate libraries when compiling a program. Each library will need to be built separately prior to building the program.

## Command Line Options

`cyclone` has the following command line options:

Option | Notes
------ | -----
`-t`            | Show intermediate trace output in generated C files
`-d`            | Only generate intermediate C files, do not compile them
`-h, --help`    | Display usage information
`-v`            | Display version information

## Generated Files

The following files are generated during the Cyclone compilation process:

File Extension | Notes
-------------- | -----
`.meta` | These text files contain the expanded version of any macros exported by a Scheme library, and allow other modules to easily use those macros during compilation. This file is not generated when compiling a program.
`.c` | C code file generated by Cyclone.
`.o` | Object file generated by the C compiler from the corresponding `.c` file.
(None) | Final executable file generated by the C compiler when compiling a program.

## Interpreter

# Licensing
