###and-let*

##- The `claws` are evaluated in the strict left-to-right order
##- For each `claw`, the `expression` part is evaluated first (or `bound-variable` is looked up)
##- If the result is #f, `and-let*` immediately returns #f
##- Otherwise, if the `claw` is of the form `(variable expression)` the `expression`'s value is bound to a freshly made `variable`
##- The `variable` is available for the rest of the `claws` , and the `body`
##- As usual, all `variable`s must be unique (like in `let*`)
