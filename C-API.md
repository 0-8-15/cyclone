# C API 

This documentation covers the C API provided by Cyclone Scheme. It is intended both to help understand how the Cyclone runtime works as well as to provide a useful reference manual when working with the Cyclone FFI.

See the [modules page](modules.html) for an overview of the major sections.

# Scheme API

Documentation for the Scheme API is maintained back at the main [API Documentation](http://justinethier.github.io/cyclone/docs/API) page.
