Initiatives:

Tier 1:
- Performance - most likely need CPS optimization and closure elimination
- pass larceny benchmarks (will require some bugfixes):
  TODO: keep track of which ones will not run, and why

  OK if test errors out if outputs directory is missing, chibi does the same thing.

    - ack.scm
    - array1.scm
    - browse.scm
    - bv2string.scm
    - cat.scm
    - compiler.scm - unbound vars: (denominator numerator)
    - conform.scm
    - cpstak.scm
    - ctak.scm
    - deriv.scm
    - destruc.scm
    - diviter.scm
    - divrec.scm
    - dynamic.scm - Need to handle optional radix argument to number->string
    - earley.scm
    - equal.scm
    - fft.scm
    - fibc.scm
    - fibfp.scm
    - fib.scm
    - gcbench.scm - Needed to manually import (srfi 9)
    - graphs.scm
    - lattice.scm
    - matrix.scm
    - mazefun.scm
    - maze.scm - There is a problem reading the input file
    - mbrot.scm
    - mbrotZ.scm - No complex library
    - mperm.scm
    - nboyer.scm
    - nqueens.scm
    - ntakl.scm
    - nucleic.scm - Runs now, but segfaults
    - paraffins.scm
    - parsing.scm
    - peval.scm
    - pi.scm
    - pnpoly.scm
    - primes.scm
    - puzzle.scm
    - quicksort.scm
    - ray.scm
    - read0.scm - needs open-input-string
    - read1.scm
    - sboyer.scm
    - scheme.scm - Problem with (macro?) being a primitive and defined in application code
    - simplex.scm - Compiles but quickly throws error Error: Divide by zero
    - slatex.scm - Need to handle more than one "args" argument to apply
    - string.scm
    - sum1.scm
    - sumfp.scm
    - sum.scm
    - tail.scm
    - takl.scm
    - tak.scm
    - triangl.scm
    - wc.scm


Tier 2:
- srfi 18 - more complex threading examples (probably can wait)
- api documentation (can wait?)
- online docs via read-the-docs?
- higher priority issues (need to be resolved, but can wait?)
  - revisit macro hygiene issues
  - library issues (name conflicts and limited feature set)
