Initiatives:

Tier 1:
- Performance - most likely need CPS optimization and closure elimination
- pass larceny benchmarks (will require some bugfixes):

  benchmarks that do not finish due to
  missing features:
    - gcbench.scm - Needed to manually import (srfi 9)
    - mbrotZ.scm - No complex library
    - read0.scm - needs open-input-string
    - scheme.scm - Problem with (macro?) being a primitive and defined in application code
    - slatex.scm - Need to handle more than one "args" argument to apply
  crashes:
    - compiler.scm - segfaults during compilation
    - maze.scm - vector-ref invalid index -6
    - nucleic.scm - Runs now, but segfaults
    - simplex.scm - Compiles but quickly throws error Error: Divide by zero

  OK if test errors out if outputs directory is missing, chibi does the same thing.

Tier 2:
- srfi 18 - more complex threading examples (probably can wait)
- api documentation (can wait?)
- online docs via read-the-docs?
- higher priority issues (need to be resolved, but can wait?)
  - revisit macro hygiene issues
  - library issues (name conflicts and limited feature set)
