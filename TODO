Initiatives:

Tier 1:
- Performance - most likely need CPS optimization and closure elimination
- pass larceny benchmarks (will require some bugfixes)

Tier 2:
- srfi 18 - more complex threading examples (probably can wait)
- api documentation (can wait?)
- online docs via read-the-docs?
- higher priority issues (need to be resolved, but can wait?)
  - revisit macro hygiene issues
  - library issues (name conflicts and limited feature set)
