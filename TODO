  - test without  gc safety checks, -g, etc. And add optimization flag
- srfi 18 - more complex threading examples
- api documentation
- syntax-rules integration (WIP, works sometimes but needs to compile smaller)
- r7rs missing features
- online docs via read-the-docs?
- revisit macro hygiene issues
- library issues (name conflicts and limited feature set)
